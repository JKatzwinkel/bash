# better syntax highlighting:
# https://github.com/craigbarnes/nanorc, 
# git://github.com/craigbarnes/nanorc.git
# provides syntax highlighting for markdown, as it seems!
# will overwrite! custom ~/.nanorc, so backup.
# will also overwrite default key bindings, so ^O will suddenly be insert main,
# ^X will be cut,
# ^V uncut,
# ^Z undo,
# ^Y redo,
# ^F both whereis & regex search (but between which can be switched with ^R),
# ^L goto line,
# ^A mark text
# quit command will be bound to ^Q,
# save bound to ^S,
# cancel bound to ^W
# key bindings help bar will be disabled, so search for 'set nohelp' to change
# syntax highlighting looks kinda weird, but seems to act quite smart
# to deactivate highlighting of trailing whitespaces, search for 'Show trailing whitespace'
# copy of modified resulting .nanorc is in .nanorc.github
# note that while it may seem the other way around, the syntax keyword
# specifies to which file names the _following_ parameters apply, not the
# preceding ones!!!
#
# Useful default keybindings:
# Use Alt+a to select a block, then Alt+} will indent the selected block,
# and Alt+{ will outdent the block.
#
# Legal colors for foreground and background color are:
# white, black, red, blue, green, yellow, magenta, and cyan.
# You may use the prefix "bright" to force a stronger color highlight
